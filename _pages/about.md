# About Me


Hello! I am Dhruv. I am a thirst year undergraduate student at **[BITS Pilani KK Birla Goa Campus](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/)** with a major in Electrical and Electronics engineering. I am a Robotics Enthusiast, and my main interests lie in I**ntelligent Control and Decision Making of Multi-Agent Systems** and **Swarm Robotics**. I am also interested in learning about the navigation and control of UAVs and in combined perception using multi-agent systems.

I am pursuing a project under [Dr. Sarang Dhongdi](https://www.bits-pilani.ac.in/goa/sarang/profile) to create Flying Ad-Hoc Networks to enable communication for a swarm of drones flying in multiple formations. I previously worked at [CSIR-CEERI](https://www.ceeri.res.in/) Pilani, supervised by [Dr. Kaushal Kishore](https://www.ceeri.res.in/profiles/kaushal-kishore/). Our work involved developing a platform-agnostic drone landing stack. Our novel work has been published in the [IMSD-ACMD](http://imsdacmd2020.iitd.ac.in/). 

I am the Sub-Coordinator of the **[Electronics and Robotics Club of BITS Goa](https://erc-bpgc.github.io/)**. I lead a team of 50+ motivated people interested in researching various aspects of Robotics. We are researching and developing robots to explore multiple fields of robotics. The club has been developing autonomous ground robots, legged robots, and advanced robotic manipulators for the past 15 years. Recently we have started a project on [Swarm Robotics](https://github.com/ERC-BPGC/swarm_bots) and Multi-Agent systems for which I am the lead. Currently, at the software stage, the team is working on achieving decentralization of multi-agent coordination in simulation.

I am also a Senior Core Member of the Center for Technical Education, BITS Goa. Center for Technical Education is an independant college organization that works towards improving the technical culture on campus through courses, workshops and hackathons.
